# Supervised Machine Learning Models for Heart Failure Prediction: Project Write-Up
This repository contains all the project files, including notebooks, datasets, and a write-up for our research project on heart failure prediction using supervised machine learning models. Please note that the write-up is currently in the process of being published and is not meant for redistribution or editing by viewers.

The source code for the project is also available for reference purposes only.

AIM: The goal of our project was to develop accurate predictive models that could determine the likelihood of a patient experiencing heart failure by analyzing various patient feature values. Additionally, we aimed to compare the performance of our models with existing research and models in this field.
